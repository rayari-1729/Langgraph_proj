## Project Structure

```
langgraph/
â”œâ”€â”€ agents/              # Basic agent examples
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 01.py           # Simple compliment agent
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 02.py           # Calculator agent

â”‚   â””â”€â”€ 04.py           # Conditional edges agent
â”œâ”€â”€ main.py             # Advanced adaptive math tutor
â””â”€â”€ README.md           # Project documentation
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- langgraph

## Installation

1. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
```bash
# On Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate

# On Unix or MacOS
source .venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies using uv (recommended):
```bash
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
# OR use the locked dependencies for exact versions
uv pip install --requirements uv.lock
```

Alternatively, using pip:
```bash
pip install langgraph
```

## Usage

Run the advanced math tutor:
```bash
python main.py
```

Or try the basic examples in the agents folder:
```bash
python agents/01.py  # Try the simple compliment agent
python agents/02.py  # Try the calculator agent
python agents/03.py  # Try the multi-node agent
python agents/04.py  # Try the conditional edges agent
```
